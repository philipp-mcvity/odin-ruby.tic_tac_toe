This is a simple tic tac toe game, build with Ruby as a practice while working through the https://www.theodinproject.com/ 's curriculum.

#### Original Assignment

Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

  1. Think about how you would set up the different elements within the game... What should be a class? Instance variable?  Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.
  2. Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.


#### Assignment 2

  Write tests.
  
  *Looking over it now, I'm heavily unsatisfied with how I wrote tic tac toe in the first place.
  I decide to leave it as it is, to move on and build upcoming projects the TDD-way from scratch to learn and adopt.*.
